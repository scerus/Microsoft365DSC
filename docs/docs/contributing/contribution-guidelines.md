## Fixing typos

Typos are embarrassing! Most PR's that fix typos will be accepted immediately. In order to make it easier to review the PR, please narrow the focus instead of sending a huge PR of fixes.

## DO's & DON'Ts

- **DO** follow the same project and test structure as the existing project.
- **DO** include tests when adding new functionality and features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
- **DO** keep discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the conversation.
- **DO NOT** submit PR's for coding style changes.
- **DO NOT** surprise us with big PR's. Instead file an issue & start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
- **DO NOT** commit code you didn't write.
- **DO NOT** submit PR's that refactor existing code without a discussion first.

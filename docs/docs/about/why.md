# What is Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration?


Microsoft365DSC is an Open-Source initiative hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft365DSC), lead by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. It allows you to write a definition for how your Microsoft 365 tenant should be configured, automate the deployment of that configuration, and ensures the monitoring of the defined configuration, notifying and acting on detected configuration drifts. It also allows you to extract a full-fidelity configuration out of any existing Microsoft 365 tenant. The tool covers all major Microsoft 365 workloads such as Exchange Online, Teams, Power Platforms, SharePoint and Security and Compliance.

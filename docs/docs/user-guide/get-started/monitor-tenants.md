Once a configuration has been applied to a tenant, the machine from which it was pushed becomes what we commonly call an M365DSC agent. This means that while this machine remains active, it will perform regular (every 15 minutes by default) to assess the tenant against the configuration that was applied, and checks for any configuration drifts. By default, when a configuration drift is detected, the agent will simply log a new error in Event Viewer under **Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft365DSC.** This default behavior can be changed by configuring the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) of the agent. Other behaviors include not taking any actions when configuration drifts are detected or automatically fixing drifts when they get detected. For more information on how to configure the agent's LCM, please refer to the [Configuring the Local Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/managing-nodes/metaConfig?view=powershell-7) article.
